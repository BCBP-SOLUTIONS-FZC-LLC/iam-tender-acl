// Package api embeds this service's machine-readable event contract so the
// running binary can serve it (GET /asyncapi, GET /asyncapi.yaml — see
// internal/adapter/inbound/http/asyncapi.go) without depending on the
// source tree being present at runtime. Dockerfile's final stage copies
// only the compiled binary into the distroless image, not the repo, so a
// disk-read-relative-path approach (the pattern iam-user-profile's own
// AsyncAPI viewer uses) would 404/500 in that image; embedding avoids the
// problem entirely and needs no Dockerfile change.
